Repository includes folders with notebooks-projects:
* `project_1_quality_controle1` - basic processing of FASTA-files (quality, GC-content) and comparison with results of FastQC.
* `project_2_short_read_alignment` - aligning of short reads (Illumina and IonTorrent), calculating coverage, analyzing quality, errors, indels, and its statistics.
* `project_3_long_read_alignment` - the same, as the second project, but with long reads (PacBio, Nanopore), its comparison.
* `project_4_errors` - Evaluation the quality of error correction (Trimmomatic and BayesHammer)
* `project_5_assembler` - assembling genome of E.Coli by De Bruijn graph construction.
* `project_6_evaluation` - evaluation of different assemblings (PacBio reads, assembling with flye; Illumina and hybrid reads, assembling with SPAdes)
* `project_7_rna` - RNA-seq analysis (aligning reads, evaluation of quality, assembling de-novo (rnaSPAdes and rnaQUAST)
(Full descriptions of each project in notebooks is in Russian)
